# JavaScript Advanced Functions: Introduction

## On Character and Programming Languages

As you learn more programming languages, you'll come to learn that they each
have a point of view, an essential view on the world. It's like how a lot of
our favorite authors or artists have a certain style that gives them away:

* Tarantino movies involve shootouts and pop culture references
* Maria Callas' _bel canto_ wedding of emotional tension with vocal
  interpretation
* Dickens novels usually feature noble, but poor, people showing virtue against
  a cold world
* Rothko paintings are huge in scope and seem designed to dominate your
  emotions

Like these creators, JavaScript has a fundamental point of view:

***JavaScript loves functions.***

JavaScript makes this love clear from our first encounter with functions.  It
makes functions first-class data. Functions, that is to say, "frozen" _work_,
can be passed around like "primitive" data (`String`s or `Integer`s, etc.).
JavaScript passes around its functions, shoves them to `Arrays`, makes them
accessible via a _key_ in an `Object`, and more.  Few other programming
languages share this point of view.

Because of JavaScript's uncommon love for functions, developers sometimes get
stymied by difficult bugs and they blame the language for it. This is
unfortunate. Don't fall victim to this pattern of behavior with JavaScript (or,
with much of anything in life): seek to understand its point of view and
appreciate the growth that search provides.

Approach JavaScript with curiosity and appreciation and JavaScript will show
you a whole new way of thinking about the world.

Those who _do_ understand JavaScript's point of view are able to:

* write compact code that works in a wide variety of situations
* grasp the design approaches of new JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue,
  Angular)
* debug subtle, yet tricky bugs

These are all abilities worth having!  So, let's get to know the mind of
JavaScript by learning some of the amazingly cool things we can do with
functions. We'll start off by doing a quick recap of the basic use and creation
of functions.
